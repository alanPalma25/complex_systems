# Dynamical Complex Systems Simulations

This repository contains simulations developed as part of my Dynamical Complex Systems course at Yachay Tech University.
The goal of this repository is to explore and analyze the behavior of nonlinear and complex systems through computational modeling.

## ðŸ“Œ Contents

- Numerical simulations of dynamical systems.

- Phase space visualizations.

- Time evolution plots of population models, oscillators, and other systems.

- Code and notes from the course.

This repository is part of coursework at Yachay Tech University â€“ School of Physical Sciences and Nanotechnology.-
